# Scheduling-in-a-Health-Call-Centre
There are various staff scheduling models specifically designed to adapt to different contexts. This work examines two scheduling models for a Portuguese healthcare call center, tailored to its unique needs and constraints, each with a different level of generality. Both models use binary linear programming (BLP) and were implemented for comparative purposes. One model was developed in this project using Jupyter and Python, leveraging the Python API of CPLEX, while the other was proposed in previous research and directly implemented in the CPLEX optimization software. The models were tested on various instances to identify their limitations and compare their performance under identical conditions. Both models produce feasible solutions, generally converging to near-optimal values and delivering results in a timely manner, making them applicable to the call centerâ€™s real-world operations.
